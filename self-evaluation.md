# Self Evaluation

- How might the `each` method be useful? I can see this method being useful when you want to list off many options or answer choices for say a test or quiz. That was the first thing that came to mind after doing challenge one: rather than go line-by-line, just run everything at once. 
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? For me I unfortunately had to do this assignment last-minute, so it's a section I forsure want to read through several times and challenge myself and my own understanding so I don't fall behind.
- What worked well for you in terms of your approach on this
assignment? Running the 'each' method in challenge 1 clicked for me because of it's (fairly) common sense command: run every array inside [], and in said order.
